# 🌍 AICTE Internship Project - Climate Risk and Disaster Management

This repository contains my AICTE Internship project on **Climate Risk and Disaster Management** using the **Global Natural Disasters Dataset** (derived from NASA’s EONET API via Kaggle). The project focuses on analyzing natural disasters such as wildfires, storms, and floods.

## 📌 Week 1 Project
In **Week 1**, the goal was to reach the **Data Understanding stage**:
- Imported necessary Python libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`)  
- Loaded the dataset (`Data.csv`)  
- Explored dataset using:
  - `.info()` → structure of data  
  - `.describe()` → summary statistics  
  - `.isnull().sum()` → missing values check  
- Previewed disaster categories and their counts  

This forms the foundation for deeper analysis and visualization in upcoming weeks.
